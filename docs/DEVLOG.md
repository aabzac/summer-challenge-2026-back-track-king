# Dev log

Format per entry: context / hypothesis -> what was done -> result -> decision.

## 2026-09-13 (contest day 6 of 14) — infrastructure day

- Stack decided: Java 17 + Gradle (familiarity over C++ speed; top-10 is 9x C++, 1x Python, so the
  game is decided by evaluation quality rather than raw speed). Skeleton, FileMerger idea and CG
  capture tooling ported from the Spring 2026 (Troll Farm) project.
- Leaderboard snapshot: 1233 players, Gold open (divisionIndex 3 = 595 players), Legend not yet.
- Wood 2 statement captured to `docs/rules/wood2.md`. Only Wood rules visible until promotion.
- `btk.core` written from the Wood statement + Java starter protocol. 15 JUnit tests
  (cost/budget, neutral clash, N/E/S/W tie-break incl. statement example 2, AUTOPLACE expansion,
  protocol round trip).
- Discovery: CG `gameResult/findByGameId` is public and returns **both players' stdout per turn**
  plus viewer events. `CgFetch` downloaded 107 Gold games of the top 15; `CgValidate` replays them
  through our engine.
  - Result: placements (cost, budget, neutral) match CG in 107/107 games up to the first ink
    effects (turns 4-11). Scoring diverges as soon as regions get inked -> DISRUPT/ink rules must
    be modelled; they are only readable from Bronze.
  - Observed: DISRUPT costs no paint; a region gets inked after N disrupts (N=2 and N=4 seen —
    depends on something: region size? tracks inside? both players?); inked regions lose tracks and
    connections break; games last 40 or 55 turns (variable — end condition unknown).
  - Top players issue exactly one DISRUPT every turn from turn 0.
- `Player.java` (v01) verified via `ProcessCheck`: first turn ~690 ms (600 ms JIT warm-up), no
  timeouts, 4/4 wins vs v00 on real CG maps.
- Visualizer works for local replays; a CG-derived local replay is written by
  `cgValidate -Pshow=<id>` for side-by-side inspection.
- Blocker for engine fidelity: Bronze statement. Manual paste of Player.java needed (Cursor browser
  cannot reach localhost, so automated paste channel is not available).

### Rules reverse-engineered from replays (later the same day)

- `CgInkStudy` over 2750 ink events: ink at instability 4 (both players' disrupts add up),
  `DISRUPT id` and `DISRUPT x y` both valid, disrupt costs no paint, town regions never targeted,
  inked regions permanent, all tracks removed. Game ends at 100 turns or when no pair can be
  connected through non-inked cells (verified on every early-ending game).
- Implemented in `btk.core` (+5 JUnit tests). **`cgValidate`: 107/107 replays reproduced exactly**
  (placements, ink, per-turn scores, paths, end turn, final score). Written up in
  `docs/rules/inferred_gold.md`.
- Connection recomputation now does one BFS per destination town (`Pathing.updateAllConnections`);
  the eval bot calls it a few hundred times per turn.

### v02 EvalBot

- Self-play with deterministic bots produced 195/200 draws: both sides choose the same best path
  and every cell becomes neutral. Added `NOISE`/`SEED` params (player id mixed into the seed) for
  benches; noted "opponent placement prediction" as a real strategic feature for v03.
- PowerShell/cmd eat `&` in `-Pbot2=current?A=1&B=2`; `Params` now also accepts `,` as separator.
- Ablation results in `docs/BOTS.md`. Frozen as `btk.bot.v02`. `procCheck`: first turn 720-810 ms
  (warm-up lowered to 500 ms), later turns <= 12 ms, avg ~2 ms.

### v03 (same night)

- Opponent model (predict their route, surcharge contested cells, place them last): no effect
  (47-51%). Zero-sum logic: a clash neutralises their track too, so avoiding it is not free.
- `CgPolicyStudy` (`gradlew cgStudy`): what winners do in the 107 Gold replays — see BOTS.md.
  Main gaps found: idle turns, early closing of the map, disrupt frequency.
- Vulnerability eval (income after the opponent's best single ink) + backup routes: 60% vs the
  same bot without backups, 58.5% vs v02. Closing rule and HORIZON made no measurable difference in
  self-play because our games do not close.
- Deterministic Player.java vs deterministic v02 produced 0-0 games (perfect mirrors, every cell
  neutral). `NOISE=0.1` is now the default. Timer margin raised to 14 ms after a 44 ms turn in
  `procCheck`; timer checked per candidate variant.
- Stopped tuning here: first get out of Wood with v03, then get the Bronze statement.

Open questions for the Bronze statement: POIs, AUTOBUILD, whether an over-budget or invalid
command is a loss or ignored, whether disrupting a town region is refused.
